# NVIM

## TODO
- Look into treesitter for code jumping (jump/highligh by function etc)
- Get a markdown previewer
- Integrate lazygit (maybe with toggleterm, see the main readme on github at the bottom)
- Explore charm tools
- Enable prettier formatting (with tailwindcss plugin)
- Add breadcrumbs SmiteshP/nvim-navic
- Maybe look at cleaning up keybinds, these are set all over the place like in terminal.lua
